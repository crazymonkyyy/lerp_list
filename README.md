##lerp list
A data structure that returns lerps between an appendable list of keys, with random access of future states, cycles and a "close enough" enough implitation of ranges you should be able to use some of the std. For quick and dirty animations.

For syntax look at app.d, to setup copy and paste lerpdata into your project.
